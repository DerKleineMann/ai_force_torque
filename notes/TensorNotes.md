## General 

1. Setup some ground rules for models   
2. Label data according to key for classification  
3. Try several types of classification :
    - Concentric
    - Quarters

Methodology : 
- Get optimal HPs
- Get optimal number of epochs
- Retrain

## Methods

### Layers

Got through trials (Hidden Layers)
Not too many hidden layers to avoid overfitting

### Activation

### Optimizers

### Losses

### Regression Metrics

MAE : General regression performance
MSE : More visible performance + outlier allergy
RMSE : Basically variance
RÂ² : How well do the features fit the model, how well will it predict

### Multiclass Classification Metrics

Precision : General accuracy
Recall : 
F1-Score : 
Support : 

## Optimization



### Hyperparameters

Batch Size
Epochs

### Search methods

Classify everything
