# AI Force Torque Control - Repository

This is the private GitHub repository for my Bachelor Thesis at Hochschule MÃ¼nchen  
For further information see the Notion page : 

## File structure

- Data folder : contains all needed formats of the training and validation data from the robot
- Legacy folder : contains every previously written piece of code on the subject
- Notes folder : irrelevant files to the program
- Feather & Temp folder : included in gitignore (too heavy)

## Installation 

All previously required library and file architecture can be checked with the "env_setup.ipynb" file
